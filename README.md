# Neural Networks - Walkthrough
## Here you'll find 2 files for each single layer and multi-layer perceptron

### Single Layer Perceptron: 
- Takes you through setting up the input / output values
- Specifying Hyper Parameters (Epochs, Learning Rate)
- Initializing Weight and Bias terms
- Looping through the Forward / Backward Pass
- Printing Final Outputs

### Single Layer Stepwise:
- Takes you through setting up the input / output values
- Specifying Hyper Parameters (Epochs, Learning Rate)
- Initializing Weight and Bias terms
- **Proceeds step by step:**
  - **Forward Pass**
  - **Backward Pass**
- Printing Final Outputs


*Please note this is to work through a neural network step by step to understand what is happening behind the scenes.*
*There is not certain aspects such as a loss curve, etc. This is outside of the scope of this project*
